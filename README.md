# portfolio
A portfolio all in basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Introduction
Honestly I want to try to regain some programming skills before my last semester at Chico State, pretty much completely ruined my brain with intense Minecraft sessions and speedcubing. 

## Objective
Create a self portfolio web site with a couple of pages to route to. Mainly want to practice Css and the usage of javascript within the code to do some fancy things.

## Outcome
Hopefully I can gain some motivation and experience when doing this as I really need to do more projects so this is a start. 

### Routes
 - Home: Simple home page that shows my face in a nice background with a list of routes that the user can go to
 - About: An introduction to who I am and I'm am studing and much more
 - Hobbies: A list of hobbies that I currently have 
 - Setup: Setup of the server and web site
